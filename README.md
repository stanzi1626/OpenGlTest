# OpenGlTest

Framework for OpenGl applications. Made with the help of the youtube series "Intro to OpenGl" by TheCherno.

Note that there are dependencies which are not included in the Github, such as SDL and ImGui.
If one wants to clone this rep, download the necessary dependencies and use the CMake file to compile them correctly to the project.
